# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
This analysis details how ride-sharing data differed by city type in 2019. The three types of cities included in the data are urban, suburban, and rural. The analysis summarizes the key differences between each environment and delves further into the data by examining the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
The number of rides and drivers is highest in urban environments and lowest in rural cities. This scarcity of rides in less populated areas means that there were fewer drivers in rural towns than in suburban or urban settings. The average fare per ride in rural environments supersedes that of urban environments by approximately ten dollars USD. This data suggests that ride-sharing is widely utilized in urban and suburban environments but less common in rural communities, perhaps due to a lack of available rides and greater distances between destinations. On average, drivers in rural towns received higher compensation for their time spent driving, but this hardly makes up for the fact that rural drivers rarely got the opportunity to work.

The total fare by city type depicted in the image below shows that ride-sharing is significantly less prevalent in rural and suburban communities. This unpopularity could be due to several factors, but the most likely culprits are higher fares and a lack of available drivers.

## Summary
Considering the expense of ride-sharing in areas with less population density, PyBer should consider temporarily lowering ride fares in rural and suburban communities. This strategy would incentivize new customers to use the service. Over time, as more people choose to participate in the PyBer ecosystem, the number of drivers and customers will increase to a self-sustainable level. First, an increased number of customers looking to take advantage of low fares will incentivize more drivers to start working for the service. Then, with more drivers, the cost per ride will begin to decrease as supply increases to meet the newly increased demand of customers.
